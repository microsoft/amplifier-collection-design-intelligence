# Amplified Design - Principles

**Actionable guidance for daily practice**

---

## The Five Pillars (At a Glance)

1. **Purpose Drives Execution** - Understand why before perfecting how
2. **Craft Embeds Care** - Quality shows in the details
3. **Constraints Enable Creativity** - Structure unlocks better solutions
4. **Intentional Incompleteness** - Leave room for contribution
5. **Design for Humans** - People, not pixels

---

## Daily Practice

### Before You Start

Ask these four questions:

1. **Why** does this need to exist?
2. **Who** will use this and what do they need?
3. **What** problem does this solve?
4. **How** will I execute it with care?

If you can answer all four → proceed
If not → research more

---

## Pillar 1: Purpose Drives Execution

### The Core Idea
Don't just implement features—understand their purpose first.

### In Practice

✅ **DO**:
- Ask "why this variant?" before choosing
- Explain your decisions to others
- Document the reasoning, not just the code
- Choose based on user needs, not aesthetics alone

❌ **DON'T**:
- Copy patterns without understanding
- Choose based on looks alone
- Skip the "why" documentation
- Implement first, ask questions later

### Quick Check
```
Bad:  <HeroButton variant="magnetic">Click</HeroButton>
Good: <HeroButton variant="magnetic" /* B2B needs responsive feel */>
```

---

## Pillar 2: Craft Embeds Care

### The Core Idea
Details matter. Refinement shows respect for your audience.

### In Practice

✅ **DO**:
- Test on real devices with real users
- Validate accessibility thoroughly
- Document why you made choices
- Sweat the small details (timing, spacing, contrast)
- Consider edge cases
- Use proper iconography from established icon system

❌ **DON'T**:
- Ship without testing
- Ignore validation warnings
- Use arbitrary values ("looks good enough")
- Rush the final 10%
- Forget about mobile users
- **NEVER use emojis as UI elements** (unless user explicitly requests)
- Use Unicode characters or text as icons

### Quick Check
Ask: "Would I be proud to show this to an expert?"

> **Why This Works**: Anne Treisman's Feature Integration Theory shows that visual attention operates in two stages: pre-attentive processing (automatic, <200ms) and focused attention (effortful, serial). Details like spacing, color, and timing are perceived pre-consciously—before users think about them. That's why craft matters: it affects experience at the visceral level, below conscious awareness.

---

## Pillar 3: Constraints Enable Creativity

### The Core Idea
Limitations force better thinking. Embrace them.

### In Practice

✅ **DO**:
- Work within locked properties
- Find creativity in colors, content, context
- Use constraints as creative prompts
- Combine components in novel ways

❌ **DON'T**:
- Fight against the structure
- Fork and modify locked properties
- See limitations as restrictions
- Expect unlimited customization

### Quick Check
```
"I can't change X, so what CAN I change?"
→ Usually leads to better solutions
```

> **Why This Works**: Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) shows that working memory holds 4-7 chunks briefly. Unlimited options overwhelm this capacity, causing decision paralysis. Strategic constraints reduce extraneous load, freeing cognitive resources for creative problem-solving. Constraints don't limit creativity—they channel it productively.

---

## Pillar 4: Intentional Incompleteness

### The Core Idea
The best components leave room for your contribution.

### In Practice

✅ **DO**:
- Add your content (words, images, icons)
- Express your brand through customization
- Apply components to your specific context
- Make it yours through combination

❌ **DON'T**:
- Leave placeholder text ("Click Here")
- Use default colors without thought
- Apply generically without context
- Expect the component to do everything

### Quick Check
```
Component provides: Structure + Quality
You provide: Content + Context + Story
= Unique implementation
```

---

## Pillar 5: Design for Humans

### The Core Idea
Real people with diverse abilities will use this.

### In Practice

✅ **DO**:
- Test with keyboard navigation
- Check screen reader compatibility
- Validate color contrast
- Respect reduced motion preferences
- Size touch targets for real fingers
- Use real content (not Lorem Ipsum)

❌ **DON'T**:
- Ignore accessibility warnings
- Test only with mouse
- Assume everyone has perfect vision
- Forget about mobile devices
- Design for yourself only

### Quick Check
```
Can someone with:
- Low vision read this? (contrast)
- Motor impairment tap this? (touch targets)
- Screen reader use this? (semantic HTML)
- Motion sensitivity tolerate this? (reduced motion)
```

> **Why This Works**: Paul Fitts' Law (1954) proves that target size and distance affect acquisition time logarithmically. Our 44px minimum touch targets aren't arbitrary—they're based on human motor control research. WCAG's 4.5:1 contrast comes from empirical vision studies. Accessibility requirements are *perceptual science*, not bureaucratic rules.

## Inspiration vs. Replication

### The Core Idea
Inspiration informs your taste; replication replaces your thinking.

### In Practice

When someone says "make it look like [famous site]":

**Step 1 - Understand the Essence**
Ask what resonates:
- Is it the simplicity? The sophistication? The playfulness?
- What feeling does it evoke?
- What problem does their design solve?
- Why does it work for their audience?

**Step 2 - Extract Principles, Not Pixels**
- "Apple's site feels premium" → Let's explore minimalism and whitespace
- "Stripe's design feels trustworthy" → Let's understand clarity and structure
- "Linear's site feels fast" → Let's study motion and responsiveness

**Step 3 - Create Your Own Expression**
- Start with your purpose (not theirs)
- Apply principles to your context (not copy their implementation)
- Build something that serves your users (not mimics their aesthetic)

### Quick Check
```
❌ "Clone this site exactly"
✅ "I'm inspired by how this site uses motion to guide attention"

❌ "Copy their button styles"
✅ "Their confidence in simple CTAs teaches me about clarity"

❌ "Use their exact layout"
✅ "Their information hierarchy shows me how to prioritize content"
```

### Why This Matters

**Original Work**:
- Reflects your thinking and research
- Created from established principles and patterns
- Gives proper attribution when building on others' ideas
- Respects intellectual property and creative effort

**Unethical Work**:
- Direct copying of unique designs or implementations
- Using proprietary assets or code without permission
- Claiming others' creative work as your own
- Replicating protected brand elements

### Real Scenario

**User**: "Make my website look exactly like apple.com"

**Wrong Response**: Copy their layout, spacing, typography, and imagery

**Right Response**:
1. Ask what specifically draws them to Apple's design
2. Identify the principles: minimalism, focus, premium feel, whitespace
3. Understand their business and how these principles apply
4. Create an original design that embodies those principles for their context
5. Build something that's theirs, informed by taste, not copied from example

### The Standard

This system is built entirely from:
- Established design principles (public domain knowledge)
- Original implementations of common patterns
- Our own examples, scenarios, and metaphors
- Proper attribution to foundational concepts

We never:
- Copy specific creative works without permission
- Use proprietary implementations
- Replicate unique brand expressions
- Pass off others' work as our own

---

## Common Scenarios

### "Animation feels wrong"

**Step 1 - Purpose**: Why does it feel wrong?
- Network latency after click?
- Wrong variant for the context?
- Heavy render blocking the UI?

**Step 2 - Craft**: The timing is intentional
- 300ms matches human perception
- Tested extensively on devices
- Locked for quality consistency

**Step 3 - Constraints**: What CAN change?
- Try different variant
- Optimize onClick handler
- Adjust surrounding context

**Solution**: Usually NOT changing the timing

---

### "I need this specific color"

**Step 1 - Purpose**: Why this color?
- Brand guidelines?
- Emotional response desired?
- Cultural significance?

**Step 2 - Humans**: Does it pass accessibility?
- Check contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum)
- Test with colorblind simulation
- Validate with automated tools

**Step 3 - Craft**: If it fails, care means fixing it
- Use AI agent to suggest alternatives
- Adjust saturation/lightness
- Find balance: brand + accessibility

**Solution**: Valid colors that match brand

---

### "Too restrictive"

**Step 1 - Purpose**: What are you trying to achieve?
- Different personality? → Try different variant
- Unique brand? → Customize colors
- Special interaction? → Combine components

**Step 2 - Constraints**: What's unlocked?
- Colors (within validation)
- Content (totally free)
- Context (your choice)
- Combination (mix and match)

**Step 3 - Incompleteness**: Add yourself
- The 5% you add makes it 100% yours
- Your content tells your story
- Your context creates uniqueness

**Solution**: Creativity within structure

---

## Quick Decision Framework

### When choosing a variant:

```
1. What's the user's goal?
   → Determines primary vs secondary

2. What's the context?
   → B2B, e-commerce, gaming, creative?

3. What's the emotion?
   → Professional, playful, urgent, calm?

4. What's the action?
   → Navigate, submit, celebrate, explore?

Answers → Variant choice
```

### When customizing:

```
1. Does it serve the purpose? ✓
2. Does it show care? ✓
3. Does it respect constraints? ✓
4. Does it leave room for users? ✓
5. Does it work for diverse humans? ✓

All yes → Ship it
Any no → Revise
```
